Change Log
==========

v4.0 - current
--------------
- [Source Code](https://github.com/CANopenNode/CANopenNode/tree/master)
- [Full ChangeLog](https://github.com/CANopenNode/CANopenNode/compare/v2.0-master...master)
### Removed
- Driver for Linux (socketCAN directory) moved to own repository https://github.com/CANopenNode/CANopenLinux.
### Changed
- New Object dictionary interface. It has similar principles as before. Main access to OD variables is via fast read/write functions, but direct access to OD variables is also possible. OD entries are passed with pointers to CANopen objects. All parts of CANopenNode objects, which works with OD entries, are rewritten.
- [CANopenEditor](https://github.com/CANopenNode/CANopenEditor) (formerly [libedssharp](https://github.com/robincornelius/libedssharp)) has new OD exporter, new project file format (standard CANopen XDD v1.1), new documentation generator, and many other improvements.
- New OD.h and OD.c files, replaces CO_OD files.
- CANopen.c and CANopen.h files redesigned. `#include OD.h` is optional. Configuration of multiple object dictionaries is possible with one CANopen device. Interface is the same, with some changes to function arguments.
- New CO_storage.h/c files enables easier integration to target system for storing OD variables.
- Rewritten SDO server. Object dictionary part is moved to CO_ODinterface.h/c files.
- Rewritten PDO. PDO mapped variables are accessed via fast read/write functions. New RPDO event timer (timeout).
- CO_Emergency is mostly rewritten. Now is much easier customisation. All other objects has been adjusted to newOD, inspected and some parts were redesigned.


v2.0 - 2020-02-25
-----------------
- [Source Code](https://github.com/CANopenNode/CANopenNode/tree/v2.0-master)
- [Full ChangeLog](https://github.com/CANopenNode/CANopenNode/compare/v1.3-master...v2.0-master)
### Removed
- All drivers removed from this project, except Neuberger-socketCAN for Linux.
### Changed
- Directory structure rearranged. Before was all CANopen object files in `stack` directory, now they are in separate directories according to standard (`301`, `305`, `extra`, `socketCAN` for Linux driver). Include directives for that files now contain directory path. `CO_SDO` renamed to `CO_SDOserver` and `CO_SDOmaster` renamed to `CO_SDOclient`. Change of the project files will be necessary.
- Driver interface clarified. Before was pair of CO_driver.h/.c files for each microcontroller, now there is common CO_driver.h file. Drivers for other microcontrollers will be separate projects. Each driver must have own CO_driver_target.h file and function definitions from C_driver.h file. See documentation in CO_driver.h, example/CO_driver_target.h and example/CO_driver.c. There was no other major changes in driver interface.
- Time base is now microsecond in all functions.
- CANopen.h/.c files simplified and changed. `CO_USE_GLOBALS` and `CO_init()` removed. Interface to those functions changed.
- `CO_NMT_sendCommand()` master function renamed and moved from CANopen.c into CO_NMT_Heartbeat.c.
- Heartbeat consumer `CO_HBconsumer_process()` optimized.
- Rename in CO_driver_target.h: `IS_CANrxNew` -> `CO_FLAG_READ`, `SET_CANrxNew` -> `CO_FLAG_SET`, `CLEAR_CANrxNew` -> `CO_FLAG_CLEAR`
- CO_driver.h file, function `CO_CANrxBufferInit()`, last argument (callback) changed from `(*pFunct)(void *object, const CO_CANrxMsg_t *message)` to `void (*CANrx_callback)(void *object, void *message)`. New functions are defined in `CO_driver_target.h` file: `CO_CANrxMsg_readIdent()`, `CO_CANrxMsg_readDLC()` and `CO_CANrxMsg_readData()`.
- It is necessary to manually update CO_OD.c file - it must include: `301/CO_driver.h`, `CO_OD.h` and `301/CO_SDOserver.h`.
- Added `void *object` argument to CO_*_initCallback() functions. API clarified.
- Add emergency receive callback also for own emergency messages.
- Heartbeat is send immediately after NMT state changes.
- SDO client is rewritten. Now includes read/write fifo interface to transfer data.
- LED indicator indication (CiA303-3) moved from NMT into own files. Now fully comply to standard.
- LSS slave is integrated into CANopenNode more directly.
- CO_driver interface: remove Emergency object dependency for reporting CAN errors, use CANerrorStatus own variable instead. Emergency object updated.
### Changed SocketCAN
- ./stack/socketCAN removed from the project, ./stack/Neuberger-socketCAN moved to ./socketCAN
- driver API updated
- CO_Linux_threads.h, function `void CANrx_threadTmr_init(uint16_t interval_in_milliseconds (changed to) uint32_t interval_in_microseconds)`
- CO_CANrxBufferInit(): remove check COB ID already used.
- change macros CO_DRIVER_MULTI_INTERFACE and CO_DRIVER_ERROR_REPORTING. To enable(disable), set to 1(0).
- Rename CO_Linux_threads.h/.c to CO_epoll_interface.h/.c and reorganize them. Move epoll, timerfd and eventfd system calls from CO_driver.c to here.
- Can run in single thread, including gateway.
### Fixed
- Bugfix in `CO_HBconsumer_process()`: argument `timeDifference_us` was set to 0 inside for loop, fixed now.
- BUG in CO_HBconsumer.c #168
### Added
- Documentation added to `doc` directory: CHANGELOG.md, deviceSupport.md, gettingStarted.md, LSSusage.md and traceUsage.md.
- All CANopen objects calculates next timer info for OS. Useful for energy saving.
- Added file CO_config.h for stack configuration. Can be overridden by target specific or by custom definitions. It enables/disables whole CanOpenNode objects or parts of them. It also specifies some constants.
- CO_fifo.h/c for fifo data buffer, used with rewritten SDO client, etc.
- CANopen gateway-ascii command interface according to CiA309-3 as a microcontroller independent module. It includes NMT master, LSS master and SDO client interface. Interface is non-blocking, it is added to mainline. Example for Linux stdio and socket is included.
